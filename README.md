## How I understand this IaC assignment
- General purpose
This assignment is designed to measure candidates' knowledge and implementation skillsregarding the general Continuos Integration and Continuous Deployment(CI/CD) as well as Infrastructure as Code(IaC). 

- Target with Infrastructure of Code tool
The main target of this part of Eficode assignment is to provision infrastrcuture using dedicated tools like AWS Cloudformation or Hashicorp Terraform. The main advantage of this method is by using dedicated tools, anyone can use a template to quickly create the same infrastructure that can deploy a production application. There are no mistakes because people do not proceed manually, and better quality infrastructure can be created by preserving and modifying templates.
